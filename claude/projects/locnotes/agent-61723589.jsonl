I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and plan for this codebase.\n\nI can see we're working in the `/Users/sriku/projects/locnotes` directory, which is a clean git repository on the main branch. The recent commits suggest this is a location-based notes application with features for managing tags and displaying location information.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- ✅ Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read commands\n- ✅ Run read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n- ✅ Design implementation plans and architecture\n- ✅ Identify patterns and provide recommendations\n\nI **cannot and will not**:\n- ❌ Create, modify, or delete any files\n- ❌ Run commands that change system state\n- ❌ Use Write, Edit, or file manipulation tools\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design solutions.
